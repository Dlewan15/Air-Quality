# Air-Quality

This project looks into the level of Nitrogen Dioxide air pollution near roadside monitoring station at Dundee Mains Loan at different times of the day over the course of a year.

Nitrogen dioxide or NO2 is an gaseous air pollutant that forms when fossil fuels such as coal, oil or diesel, are burnt in high temperatures. It gets in the air from emissions from cars, trucks and buses. NO2 is harmful to humans causing respiratory issues and worsening of lung and heart diseases. It also has a negative environmental effect contributing to the formation of acid rain and ozone.

The main questions I would like to answer are:

   - when the level of the Nitrogen Dioxide is higher in this specific roadside location in Dundee?
   - can we observe daily/monthly and seasonal patterns of the NO2 level fluctuations?

By finding out the trends in NO2 level fluctuations we can mitigate its harmful effects on human health.

Data collection

To look into the dayily/monthly fluctuations of NO2 levels in Dundee I created my own dataset using data from the online UK-AIR database on the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) website https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector_service?#mid. A data on pollutants at different locations can be sourced from there.

1. Cleaning and transforming of the data and initial analysis were done in Python, the code is available in the file Final_Air_Quality_Mini_Project.ipyn
2. Raw air quality data is in file AirQualityDataHourly.csv and cleaned data is available in Clean_air_quality(2).csv
3. Data visualisation has been prepared in PowerBI, the dashboard is in AirQuality.pbix
